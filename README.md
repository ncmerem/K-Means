# K-Means

## Description
In this project, I used K-Means Clustering to group x data into 3 classes. This data is from the Iris Dataset, hosted by the UCI Machine Learning Repository and included with scikit-learn. I also used K-means Clustering to apply Color Quantization, a lossy compression technique, on several images. This process reduces the number of colors displayed in each image from thousands of unique colors to 64, while maintaining appearance quality. 

## Libraries Used
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- scikit-image
- matplotlib
